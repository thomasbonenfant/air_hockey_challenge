This is the source code for the Air Hockey Challenge.

Branch `warm up` is a miror of the official current release of the challenge environment

Branch `custom_environment` is our development branch where we modify the original environment.

## Custom Environment branch
### Usage
The `CustomEnvironmentWrapper` needs to be used with an agent submitting a size (3,) ndarray

Be aware that for now example agents and baseline cannot be used with this environment
